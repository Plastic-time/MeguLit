# MeguLit accounts and cloud sync (E378)

Email + 6-digit code login and opt-in sync of words, saved sentences, reading totals and per-game settings.
Server: `relay/src/accounts.js` + `relay/migrations/0005_accounts.sql`. Client: `services/account.cjs`,
Settings → 账号 (`web/account-ui.js`). Nothing is deployed by this branch.

## Wiring into the relay router

Done in E379 (feature/leaderboard-relay): `worker.js` routes accounts paths, uses `authenticate` for the leaderboard
identity, and `DELETE /api/me` also removes the account's leaderboard rows and avatar. Original instructions, kept for reference:

`relay/src/worker.js` (leaderboard branch) owns the router; this branch does not edit it. After the merge, add two lines:

```js
import {handleAccounts,isAccountsPath} from './accounts.js';
```

and in `handle()`, inside the `try`, right after the global `ip` rate-limit check and before the `NOT_FOUND` fallback:

```js
else if(isAccountsPath(path))response=await handleAccounts(request,env,now);
```

`handleAccounts` does its own per-route rate limits on the shared `rate_limits` table and returns a `Response`
(or `null` for paths it does not own). The global CORS block already allows the `authorization` header; the desktop
app calls from Node with no Origin, so no CORS change is needed.

## Deploy steps (debug session)

1. `npx wrangler d1 migrations apply megulit-relay --remote` (applies `0005_accounts.sql` after `0001_init.sql`;
   rename it if another migration takes that number, order only has to stay after 0001).
2. Secrets:
   - `npx wrangler secret put RESEND_API_KEY` (from `E:\MeguLit\secrets\relay.txt` once the user adds it).
     Until it exists, `POST /api/auth/code` answers `503 EMAIL_NOT_CONFIGURED` and the app says so.
   - optional `npx wrangler secret put AUTH_PEPPER` (any long random string; falls back to `HASH_SALT`).
     Changing it later invalidates pending codes only.
3. Resend: verify the `megulit.com` domain (SPF/DKIM records in Cloudflare DNS) and keep **open and click tracking
   off** for it. The mail has no links and no images. Sender: `mail@megulit.com` (`MAIL_FROM` var overrides).

## Endpoints

| Method | Path | Body / query | Answer |
|---|---|---|---|
| POST | `/api/auth/code` | `{email}` | `{ok,expiresIn:600}`; 429 `RATE_LIMITED` (1/min and 5/h per email, 20/h per IP); `502 EMAIL_SEND_FAILED`. Waits for Resend at most 1.5 s (`SEND_WAIT`, `MAIL_WAIT_MS`), then answers `{ok,expiresIn,sending:true}` and finishes in `ctx.waitUntil`; a late failure deletes the code, so verify says `NO_CODE` |
| POST | `/api/auth/password` | `{login,password,device}` | login = e-mail or user name; same answer as verify; `WRONG_PASSWORD` for every failure, 429 `RATE_LIMITED` |
| POST | `/api/me/username` | `{username}` | once only: `USERNAME_INVALID`, `USERNAME_TAKEN`, `USERNAME_LOCKED` |
| POST | `/api/me/password` | `{password,current?}` | 8–128; `current` needed unless the session is <10 min old: `WRONG_PASSWORD`, `PASSWORD_LENGTH`, `PASSWORD_WEAK` |
| POST | `/api/auth/verify` | `{email,code,device}` | `{token,accountId,email,sessionId,expiresAt}`; `WRONG_CODE` (+`triesLeft`), `CODE_EXPIRED`, `TOO_MANY_TRIES`, `NO_CODE` |
| GET | `/api/me` | Bearer | `{accountId,email,createdAt,sessionId,username,hasPassword,devices[],usage,limits}` |
| POST | `/api/auth/logout` | `{sessionId?}` | revokes this device, or another device of the same account |
| DELETE | `/api/me` | Bearer | deletes the account, all sessions, all synced records |
| GET | `/api/sync/:kind` | `?since=<seq>&limit=` | `{records:[{key,updated_at,deleted,data}],cursor,more}` |
| PUT | `/api/sync/:kind` | `{records:[{key,updated_at,deleted?,data?}]}` | `{accepted,newer:[server records that won],cursor}` |

Kinds and caps (per account): `words` 8 MB / 32 KB per record, `sentences` 4 MB / 8 KB, `reading` 1 MB / 1 KB,
`settings` 512 KB / 32 KB. At most 500 records and 2 MB per PUT. Over the cap → `413 SYNC_QUOTA_EXCEEDED`.

Tokens: `mgl_` + 32 random bytes (base64url), stored as sha256. Sliding 180-day expiry. Rotated on use at most once a
day: the new token comes back in the `x-megulit-token` response header, and the old one keeps working for 24 h so a
lost response never logs the user out. Codes: 6 digits, only `sha256(pepper:email:code)` stored, 10 minutes, 5 tries,
deleted on success. Conflicts: last writer wins on the client's `updated_at` (ms); on a tie a tombstone wins, then the
larger JSON, so every replica picks the same record (`newerRecord`, mirrored in `services/account.cjs`).

## Leaderboard: using the account id

`accounts.js` exports `authenticate(request,env,now)` → `{account:{id,email},session,token}` or `null`. The leaderboard
branch can, after the merge:

- client (`services/leaderboard.cjs`): when `require('./account.cjs').status(root).loggedIn`, send the session as
  `authorization: Bearer <token>` (get it with `account.token(root)`) next to the install id;
- server (`leaderboardPost`): `const auth=await authenticate(request,env,now);` and, when present, use
  `id_hash = sha256('account:'+auth.account.id)` instead of `sha256(installId)`, so one person on two PCs is one row.
  Keep the install-id path for people without an account. `GET /api/me` returns `accountId` for display/debug.
- `DELETE /api/me` does not touch leaderboard rows; if the leaderboard keys rows by account, add
  `DELETE FROM leaderboard_* WHERE id_hash=?` for that hash to `deleteAccount` in `accounts.js`.

## Privacy

Only the kinds the user leaves on are uploaded. Records carry no game paths, executables, cover files, logs or
install ids: game references are titles; settings are the per-game style profile with every path-like key and value
removed (`services/account.cjs` `cleanSettings`, tested). The email is used only to send the code and is shown only to
its owner in `/api/me`.
